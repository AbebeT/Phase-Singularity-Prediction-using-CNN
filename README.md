# Phase-Singularity-Prediction-using-CNN
Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and Ventricular tachycardia are sustained by reentrant activity. This reentrant activity propagates repeatedly along a closed path forming a spiral wave of activation in 2D and a scroll wave in 3D. Spiral waves are attributed by a wavebreak at the center of the spiral. The core of spiral wave is referred as phase singularity (PS). At the point of phase singularity the phase of the wave is undefined. PSs play a major role in triggering functional reentry and thus assist in sustaining cardiac arrhythmias. Quantifying the number of phase singularities which are the organizing sources of the reentrant waves gives us the key for understanding the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias.

This projects aims to predict the electrical instabilities induced due to myocaridal fibrosis in human ventricle model by leveraging machine learning algorithm. Sliced MRI images of a ventricle are employed as input to the Convolutional Netrual network.
