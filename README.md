# Phase-Singularity-Prediction-using-CNN
Prediction of phase singularity amount using sliced image of spatial distribution of fibrosis in a ventricular model 

This projects aims to predict the electrical instabilities induced due to myocaridal fibrosis in human ventricle model by leveraging machine learning algorithm. Sliced MRI images of a ventricle are employed as input to the Convolutional Netrual network.
